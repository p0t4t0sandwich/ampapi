A program that automagically updates a JSON file and a human readable file with the AMP API methods.

## Usage

For the JSON response of `API.Core.GetAPISpec`:

<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p0t4t0sandwich/ampapi-spec/main/APISpec.json>

For the human readable response of `API.Core.GetAPISpec` (easier to check for differences):

<https://github.com/p0t4t0sandwich/ampapi-spec/blob/main/FriendlySpec.txt>

API module inheritance for different instance types:
